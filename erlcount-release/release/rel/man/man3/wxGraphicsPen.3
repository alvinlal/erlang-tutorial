.SH NAME
wxGraphicsPen \- Functions for wxGraphicsPen class
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A \fIwxGraphicsPen\fR\& is a native representation of a pen\&. The contents are specific and private to the respective renderer\&. Instances are ref counted and can therefore be assigned as usual\&. The only way to get a valid instance is via \fIwxGraphicsContext:createPen/2\fR\& or \fIwxGraphicsRenderer::CreatePen()\fR\& (not implemented in wx)\&.
.LP
This class is derived (and can use functions) from: \fIwxGraphicsObject\fR\&
