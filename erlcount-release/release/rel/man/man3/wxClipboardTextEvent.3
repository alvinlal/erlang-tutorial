.SH NAME
wxClipboardTextEvent \- Functions for wxClipboardTextEvent class
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This class represents the events generated by a control (typically a \fIwxTextCtrl\fR\& but other windows can generate these events as well) when its content gets copied or cut to, or pasted from the clipboard\&.
.LP
There are three types of corresponding events \fIwxEVT_TEXT_COPY\fR\&, \fIwxEVT_TEXT_CUT\fR\& and \fIwxEVT_TEXT_PASTE\fR\&\&.
.LP
If any of these events is processed (without being skipped) by an event handler, the corresponding operation doesn\&'t take place which allows preventing the text from being copied from or pasted to a control\&. It is also possible to examine the clipboard contents in the PASTE event handler and transform it in some way before inserting in a control - for example, changing its case or removing invalid characters\&.
.LP
Finally notice that a CUT event is always preceded by the COPY event which makes it possible to only process the latter if it doesn\&'t matter if the text was copied or cut\&.
.LP
Note: These events are currently only generated by \fIwxTextCtrl\fR\& in wxGTK and wxOSX but are also generated by \fIwxComboBox\fR\& without wxCB_READONLY style in wxMSW\&.
.LP
See: \fIwxClipboard\fR\& 
.LP
This class is derived (and can use functions) from: \fIwxCommandEvent\fR\& \fIwxEvent\fR\&
