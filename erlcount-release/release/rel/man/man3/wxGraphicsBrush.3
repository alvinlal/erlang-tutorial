.SH NAME
wxGraphicsBrush \- Functions for wxGraphicsBrush class
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A \fIwxGraphicsBrush\fR\& is a native representation of a brush\&. The contents are specific and private to the respective renderer\&. Instances are ref counted and can therefore be assigned as usual\&. The only way to get a valid instance is via \fIwxGraphicsContext:createBrush/2\fR\& or \fIwxGraphicsRenderer:createBrush/2\fR\&\&.
.LP
This class is derived (and can use functions) from: \fIwxGraphicsObject\fR\&
